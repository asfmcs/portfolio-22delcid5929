    <h5><strong>Starting off</strong></h5></td>
    <div class="input"><p>This year I came to the Computers class with my mind wide open. I wanted to learn as much as possible since this is a topic that really interests me. We have been getting most of our learning through Khan Academy, which I really like because it's something you can go back to instead of getting left behind as in a regular lesson. We started by learning some of the basic HTML stuff. Mostly about headings, paragraphs, breaks and other things which were mostly about the format of your webpage. Of course, these factors really helped me on my prgramming journey because you have to start somewhere. Though, I did have a lot of ease when learning it and then applying it. </p></div>
    <br>
    <div class="input"><p>Then, we started working on our first project. For this project we had to make a Travel Web Page. We had to present the place we wanted our viewers to go to, and convince them of why they should go there. We would put certain things like tourist attractions, fun facts, and other interesting things. I chose Bora Bora, a beach in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I've always really wanted to go to this place! Getting back on track, I put a lot of effort in this web page, not only in the HTML but also the CSS, since I wanted to do more than what I have just learned. I used a webpage called <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools.</a> In here you can find a bunch of interesting things that you can do with HTML or CSS and I tried expererimenting with them, and as a result I had a very funky looking website, but I liked it!</p></div>

    <h3 id="secondPost">Second Day.</h3>
    <h4><em class="date">March 4 2019</em></h4>
    <h5><strong>Continuation of my Journey</strong></h5>
    <div class="input"><p>Now that it is another day, I feel much more relaxed and refreshed. This will help me learn more, and faster so that my websites can result with more quality, and I'll have a higher amount of things i can add to them aswell. We have now shifted the focus towards CSS. We have learned more about how to change font styles, text-decorations, and mostly base off the whole lesson on the way that our websites can look by using CSS. Some of the things that I find most useful for CSS is many of the color tools. Such as, background-color. I use this one a lot because color can have a lot of impact on the way your page looks and feels, so by using a correct palette you can send a message out to your viewers with much more impact. This is why I try to stay away from the simple white backgrounds, only in certain cases.</p></div>
    <div class="input"><p>We have started another project which is this blog. I have decided to use many different fonts for my sites because I can make it look a lot better by using a variety of fonts. Also, I felt that I should put a lot of effort into making this blog so that it can help me notice of the things that I have learned, this way I can recap everything that I have done. THe reacp will mostly help me with understanding what I'm learning and making me keep it inside my mind for a longer period of time. In conclusion, this programming journey has been really wonderful, and I have really liked the world of programming, I hope we can learn many different languages, and that we learn to do many other things with HTML and CSS so our websites can become much better than what they are right now. </p></div>
